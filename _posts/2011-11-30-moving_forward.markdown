Exactly a year ago, I signed my offer letter with ExactTarget for an extended six month internship to gain professional experience and to grow as a software developer. Even though I had received other offers at the time, I was curious to see what ET , placing #2 in Indiana's Best Places to Work (behind Microsoft), really had to offer.

#### My Time at ET

During this six month period, I worked with applications pertaining to ET's email products with amazing people (not limited to software engineers). I am grateful to all those who were patient with me and guiding me throughout the way, with regard to learning and producing quality code. In the end, lots of fun times were had and memories were made.

From feedback I received from my fellow co-workers, my work at ET has been solid and it definitely felt like I had made a place for myself in the rapidly expanding pool of 1500+ employees. I don't think I'd be wrong to say that many people around my age would kill for the safety/security that I [felt like I] was able to enjoy when August came by and I had to decide whether I wanted to stay or move beyond the foothills.

#### Interviews, Choices, and Decisions

As an out of state student that is 2500+ miles from home, the feeling that you're out of your comfort zone is not very distant, definitely more so when you don't demographically fit in the majority or larger minority of the population. That being said and having already worked two summers in Indianapolis, it was time to seek new avenues and challenges.

Outside of the Midwest, nobody's really heard of the small engineering school I'm from...unless they come out of Purdue University \[and perhaps Stanford University as well?\] (and even then...that can be a hit or miss). If we couple that with a high signal-to-noise ratio in regards to applicants per software engineering position, it often ends up being a huge painful process (assuming no current connections or other ways to boost your way into the door). Funny thing was that I was asked the FizzBuzz question in an instance, and in moments like these, it does make you wonder whether you're being taken seriously.

As deadlines loomed with finalizing decisions, I was very fortunate to have the folks at ET fly me to San Francisco for a day of informal interviews at ET's Social Media Labs to meet the team and see the potential opportunity of work there next summer. The experience was very positive and convinced me that the Bay Area would be the next place I call home.

#### The Decision

I've always considered working in the Valley/Bay Area to be a significant milestone that I aspired to achieve during my career. Having received opporuntities of work in this area, it's been quite accomplishing.

After long hours of thought and weighing out all my options, I have decided join the team at [Ooyala](http://ooyala.com) (located in Mountain View, California,  next summer) I had one heck of an interview experience with them as well, and I am confident that they will be able to further challenge me and allow me to develop my career in Silicon Valley/the Bay Area.

#### Leaving ET

Leaving ET has taken a certain toll on me since it's not every day that one has the opportunity to meet outstanding folks that are very talented and love what they do. While there is no doubt that all the team members whom I've interacted with in Indianapolis and San Francisco will face new challenges as ET maintains its leading position as the world's largest and innovative marketing SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) company, I am confident that each and every one of you will continue to do amazing things for ET and beyond.
