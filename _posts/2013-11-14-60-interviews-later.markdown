I'm still interviewing, but I've noticed a ton of things along the way.

#### Me

Upcoming CS student that is graduating soon with a 3.2 overall GPA; Two Internships and 1 Co-Op under my belt; Effectively no side projects (school projects don't count).

#### Starting out

##### Applying

I've been used to taking advantage of the opportunities at my school's career fair. However, at a relatively unknown school, opportunities are limited and it's gotten to the point that these opportunties no longer align with my career goals.

During Year 3 of college, I started taking the shotgun approach on various job boards (mostly Indeed and some HN). Usually, these job boards (minus HN) are black holes, so it was surprising that I got anything back. Amusingly enough, it worked.

So came Year 4, I decided to take a second go at this approach. Reflecting upon it now, I must've gotten really lucky with it last year.

In both years, the reply-back rate from applications for interviews, in my case, was approximate 10-20%. It's not terrible though applying to 100-200 positions can get easily tiring.

##### Interviewing

Interviewing well is something that is usually never covered in academia. That's perfectly fine because that's what mock interviews are for. I regret not doing a whole lot before I started interviewing.

I'd like to think that **interviewing is akin to starting an engine in cold weather (e.g. -15C)**. The first couple of interviews will be tendency to be rough. I've failed some trivial interview problems that would make me question whether I should still be in this profession.

It took me roughly 6-7 or so interviews to get me going. Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there.

### Observations

##### Location Matters

The location of a firm's primary engineering team matters. It's what dictates the engineering culture for the rest of the team, in terms of talent and the hiring bar.

It may be shallow to judge locations based on the difficulty of interview questions, though seeing the similarities among firms in a particular area is a way to see where this bar is at.

**Example Questions:**

*These are just general themes of questions I've found. They're not meant to be actual questions.*

**Indianapolis:**

  * Explain ([INSERT OOP Concept Here] | Race Conditions | Deadlocks)
  * Find the mode in an array
  * Find the number of times a date occurs in a specific log


**New York :**

  * Given information about user purchase/visit history, implement collaborative filtering to come up with appropriate recommendations for an user.
  * Write a function to find the greatest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree, given a parent pointer.
  * Implement a function that calculates active split times (per kilometer) given locational data, time, taking into account that data must be structured to account for the user turning the stopwatch off/on when the user is not active.

**San Francisco/SV :**

  * Given a set of blocked numbers on a keypad and a series of allowed possible moves, write a function to compute the number of combinations that can be used to crack a lock.
  * Design and implement a router (MVC) that is used in many web frameworks (e.g. single page Javascript applications).
  * Design and implement a transactional key-value store.
  * Implement a function that calculates the volume of water if all holes modeled by [ some picture of a curve in a graph] were filled just to the tip.

Back when I was working in Indianapolis, I never really saw that there was a "brain drain" (as it was called) across the entire state. Interviewing with other companies helped me realize that the bar was definitely set in different places.

NYC/SF/SV definitely seem to be seller's markets when it comes to new grads entering the workforce.

While interview questions tend to reveal little about a candidate (other than being a rather random indicator of problem solving ability), they help subcommunicate the nature of the engineering team and (hopefully) the problems they solve. However, this particular data point becomes less relevant if these type of (academic) questions are used when a company's engineering division is not firmly established (which would indicate other things about said company as well).

It's understandable that a lot of companies want to hire the best. On the other hand, it's a kill-joy when one feels that the interview problems one has faced are harder than most things done during the tensure of one's time in a company. I would hope that it is just an intern syndrome (because of a short time in a company).

#### Being an Intern

It's probably my gut feeling, but getting through intern level interviews were much easier than full-time interviews. There seemed to be much more room for error. Using internships and performing well leads to return offers, which tend to be much easier than full-time interviews for very obvious reasons.

#### Hearing Back

Good news comes fast while bad news comes last is the pattern that I've been noticing with smaller firms. It is less predictable with larger firms given the sheer amount of applicants that have to be moved along the system each day.

## Things I Would've Done Differently

Looking back, I would've structured ~10-15 very difficult mock interviews and simply spending several hours each day on interview problems before starting the job hunt. It can be depressing to not do well on a company that seems like it would be a top choice.

While the shotgun approach allowed for the use of technical phone screens as practice (as I have done in the past), it's unwise to waste too many and write them off as "practice".

Having side projects that a firm can see may have provided better indicators over pure technical phone screens. It varies a lot from company to company, but some, every now and then,  would use it as a substitute for phone screens.
