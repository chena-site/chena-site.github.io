Time flies and I'm seven classes away from graduating. Where has the time gone?

#### A Glimpse of My College Career
(along with small milestones, of which I thought, were of some significance)

##### 2010

- Matriculated into Rose-Hulman studying Computer Engineering
- Traveled to New York/New Jersey/East Coast for the first time
- Started programming in the Winter quarter of 2010
    - first introductory class in Python/C

##### 2011

- Learned Java and Object-Oriented Programming/Design in the Spring
- Traveled to Illinois
- Interned with Slingshot SEO (now known as digitalrelevance) and met some awesome folks
    - First working exposure to PHP, mySQL , frameworks , and design patterns (MVC)
- First time in Iowa
- Switched majors from Computer Engineering to Computer Science beginning sophomore year

##### 2012

- First exposure to Scheme/LISP. Fun times.
- Interned with ExactTarget for 6 months , skipping fall quarter of 2012.
    - First working exposure to Javascript on both client/server-side (Node.js/Backbone.js/jQuery)
- Learned Ruby on Rails for a client project (first time using Ruby)
- Explored San Francisco (on my own) for the first time and went back a second time that year

##### 2013

- Went to Toronto and Chicago for the first time; Lots of fun and met lots of new people.
- To be completed...


#### Takeaways

College seems to be the time for a lot of people to learn about themselves and experience new things. If I had to list my takeaways , it would be something along the lines of the following:

- Always be curious and the places/people one will go/meet will surprise you.
- Going beyond the comfort zone is fun , exciting, and, sometimes, a little daunting.
- Traveling alone helps one learn about themselves from a different light and be more comfortable in solitude. Don't wait to travel.
- Take smart risks and be fearless.
- 80% of your memories come from 20% of your experiences.
- Opportunities open and close like doors. Be the one that opens them instead of those who wait for them to open.
- Embrace failure as an opportunity to grow - the only way to go from there is up.
- Trying to please everybody is a perpetual game that does not need to be played.
- As long as you're comfortable with your sense of self, everything is okay.

**Takeaways specific to my particular studies/major:**

- I was surprised by the number of people in the industry that did not complete college or were self-taught.
- Experience trumps GPA every time (or at least when it comes to the less traditional companies).
- Summers should not go to waste given the number of opportunities available.
- The value of a master's degree in CS (if not on the road for a PhD) is declining/not worth it. (quoting Hacker News)


## The Future

This is a topic that often comes up and I believe more so as the months eventually get closer to graduation. The truth is : I don't know. This is more likely to be discussed in a future post in the upcoming months (or whenever I decide to begin my full-time hunt).


## What if? : The Alternative Life

Back in high school, I was always working with computer hardware and IT-related problems. Back then, I considered myself much more suited to the studies in Informatics as I was applying to schools.

Would I have done well in such a program? Definitely, but I would have probably been really bored and I probably wouldn't have encountered the opportunities that made me who I am today.
